# CS111 autograder and test cases

Autograding scripts for Wellesley's [CS111](http://cs111.wellesley.edu) (Introductory CS) course. The program evaluates student Python code on a suite of test cases, and generates HTML outputs with error hints, as well as plaintext logs. It supports grading for a variety of functions, including those with print statements and graphics.

Currently in active development. The codebase is adapted from the [Berkeley AI autograder](http://ai.berkeley.edu/).
